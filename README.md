# LightsGUI

A project made for an Otago University assignment by Ben Highsted & Matthew Neil.

LightsGUI is a user interface which lets users create a light circuit, which they can solve by interacting with the lights.

There are also options to reset the circuit, solve the circuit, show the circuit and show instructions on how to solve.
